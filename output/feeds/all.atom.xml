Why do I feel it is necessary
to write something about myself here? The way I see it there are at least
a couple of reasons for doing so. However, I will only elaborate upon a
single one: the reason to put the blog into perspective. The title could
have been "a full disclosure" for that matter. With an ever increasing
influence of the social web 2.0 twitterish blogosphere, it is important,
IMHO, that we know why certain people are saying what they are saying. As
a reader it matters to me, I want to know if the writer of an article has a
double agenda. Even though this blog, like many others, will have close to
zero impact on the grand scheme of things I believe it matters. It is only
fair and decent that we know who wrote something for what reason. All in
the name of transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;born and raised in the region of Antwerp, Belgium (that's in Europe)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a Steinerschool adept (aka Waldorf school,
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steiner_school"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;), from
kindergarten until the end of high school (3-18 years)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;professionally active in wind energy research: studied &lt;a href="http://www.lr.tudelft.nl/en/"&gt;aerospace
engineering&lt;/a&gt; at the TU Delft, did a PhD
at &lt;a href="http://www.vindenergi.dtu.dk/English.aspx"&gt;DTU Wind Energy&lt;/a&gt; in Denmark,
and decided to continue working there as a
&lt;a href="http://www.dtu.dk/Service/Telefonbog/Person?id=59332"&gt;post-doc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;during my studies it became clear to me that sustainability (being green,
respect nature and human society, etc) is not only of paramount importance,
but it is also a seriously interesting field in engineering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;seriously enthusiastic about the open source software and the corresponding
movement; needless to say, I am a Linux user (Arch Linux to be precise)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;actively support the &lt;a href="http://www.groen.be"&gt;Green political party&lt;/a&gt;
in Flanders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;injustice, extreme greed, and inefficient engineering processes are my
pet peeves&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;art is important&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So any ramblings you will find here can be expected to be of a greenish
inspired kitchen, are often marinated with open source dogma's, and are
usually cooked on the left spectrum of the stove.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="about"></category></entry><entry><title>Initiate Blog</title><link href="http://davidovitch.github.com/dada-blog/initiate-blog.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-12-03T10:20:00+01:00</updated><author><name>David Verelst</name></author><id>tag:davidovitch.github.com,2010-12-03:dada-blog/initiate-blog.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is the content of my super blog post.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="thats"></category><category term="awesome"></category></entry></feed>
