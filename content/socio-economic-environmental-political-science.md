Summary: A plea for more radical open source socio-economic-environmental-political science


Introduction
------------

A naive and far from complete argument is presented here to suggest that political
decisions should be backed by more elaborate, open, and transparent studies
that guide policy makers today. This specific art form is defined here as
socio-economic-environmental-political science. At the end of the post the
respective Belgian context is briefly illustrated as an example.


What is socio-economic-environmental-political science?
--------------------------------------------------------

I am sure this definition is used literally in other places as well, but let's
define it clearly for this post:

> The act of transparently and openly estimating, monitoring and evaluating the
social, environmental and economical impact of legislation.

I would argue that this encompasses an in depth study of the interactions between
economics, sociology, the environment and politics. Typical questions I would
like to see being addressed could be

> What is the socio-economic return of extending a ring road in a densely
populated urban area? What are the environmental and public health issues, and
how do they relate to any economic return? What is the required political 
capital considering a range of opinions of interested parties, and what type of
solution is supported by how many people?

This is what I would call an impossible question to answer with great detail.
However, this is in reality a very typical problem encountered by politicians.
There is no way even a fraction of the solution space can be explored since so
many people's opinions are involved. Also, modelling the impact of certain
measures can not be done accurately within a short time frame. Yet during such
a decision making process many studies will be ordered and paid for. The results
of different studies will usually vary significantly.

I am not saying that these kinds of problems are not being investigated by
politicians. The point I try to make is that currently the performed
studies are islands, and their methodologies and data sets are not always 
clearly shared and motivated. The term reproducibility is nowhere to be found. A profound 
debate on assumptions, boundary conditions, data sets, and governing equations 
only takes place behind closed doors of the paid consultants executing the study.
Yet these decisions are important and shape the outcome of the study significantly. 
If a decision process is supposed to be democratic (which I clearly
think it should), then the studies supporting this process should be as open and
transparent as possible. Additionally, this could encourage democratic participation
from many different actors and organisations who have an interest in either the
process in itself or the outcome. For instance, 
mobility experts and engineers can review methodologies used assessing mobility
impacts, while economics can argue about the corresponding economic impact,
and environmental scientists contribute correspondingly. This widens the in origin
political debate significantly to other layers of society and that is a good thing.
In openly and transparently doing so, a broadly carried consensus is more likely to be found.
Additionally, it is often cheap to denounce studies ordered and paid by certain
political families or interest groups due to the assumed bias. If
studies carry a more neutral weight, such a political move might be expensive
in terms of public support.

Politics needs its own Github: an open collaborative space where studies,
data, results, analysis can be shared, and discussed. How decisions are formed
should be tracked, pros and cons need to be clear at all times, and who's in
favour and against can be on display. 

Needless to say, creating such an environment is a huge challenge. 
Although far from trivial, the technical aspects are not the real problem as
the social internet industry (Github, Facebook, Twitter, Skype, ...)
demonstrates every day. Heck, people are already building an open source
infrastructure as we speak that could support such work flows, see for instance:
[adhocracy](https://liqd.net/en/) (code is on [Github](https://github.com/liqd/adhocracy/))
and [loomio](https://www.loomio.org/).

The most difficult problem to tackle is to convince policy makers
that absolute transparency in the decision making process
(including the studies on which it bases itself) is the only way forward
to lift the democratic process to the next level.


Very short primer on Belgian politics
-------------------------------------

Belgian politics are a mess. I would assume politics are messy by definition,
but I am more familiar with the Belgian political scene than any other. 
Growing up as a native in a country usually has that effect. What particularly
makes Belgium such a mess is that we have close to 11 million inhabitants spread
over 3 semi independent small regions governed by no less than
[six governments and parliaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_governments_in_Belgium).
However, the technicalities of the Belgian political scene and structure are not
the focus of this post. If you want to learn more about Belgium's political
structure, you can start browsing Wikipedia [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium),
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Belgium), and 
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_parties_in_Belgium).


Independent review of promises made during election time
---------------------------------------------------------

And now to the Belgian context. When political parties layout their
campaigns and mark their priorities for the upcoming legislation, the
implications of proposed legislative measures
on the budget and society are at best guestimates. These guestimates are usually
created by in-house study groups employed by the respective political parties. 
Often these people have political ambitions as well, and it implies that the
presented studies are likely to be biased. For example, party A will present their studies
in support of the presented action plan. Parties C to Z will show exactly the
same positive results for wildly varying policies. In politics the solution
space for societal problems approaches infinity, and in the end it all boils
down to making choices and compromises, marking priorities and making decisions.
The downsides of these promised legislative choices are hardly emphasized
during campaigning, if at all. No transparent fact checking on the proposals is
performed, and used calculation methods and data sets are not shared openly. 

In The Netherlands the "Central Planning Bureau" 
([CPB](http://www.cpb.nl/onderwerp/verkiezingen)) acts as a third party
arbiter during election times verifying the economic context of the political claims.
In Belgium there is no such thing, there is no organised fact checking on what
political parties promise while seducing voters before the elections.
Applying a solid open and transparent socio-economic-environmental-political
science framework would in my opinion help the quality of the public debate.

For the upcoming 2014 [elections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Belgium)
in Belgium, two parties have raised exactly these concerns.
You can read their brief statements as reported by Flemish newspaper The Standaard
[here](http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20140129_044) and
[here](http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20140129_00954330). Not all is lost, and
at least some politicians agree at least partly with some of the statements 
placed here.
