Summary: Open tools for transparent participative and democratic decision making


Introduction
------------

There are ample problems in modern society, and I believe a partly broken
democratic process is one of them. The traditional top down decision making 
process is under pressure since it seems to favour well organized and wealthy 
groups who do not necessarily have any democratic backing. Some would argue that
influential
[lobby](http://corporateeurope.org/blog/lobby-power-surfaces-eu-election-campaign-theme) 
groups in Brussels close to the European Commission are a good example of this.
When discussing politics and power in general at all times we should remember
that:

> Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. 
Great men are almost always bad men. 
~ Sir John Dalberg-Acton, 8th Bt
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_corrupts),
[phrases.org](http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/absolute-power-corrupts-absolutely.html)
)


From a practical perspective it seems surely more manageable to discuss top
level politics with a limited set of partners that represent industries, 
institutes, unions, people and alike. But then the internet happened which
could help scale the problem of democratic participation to a much larger group
of people. There are two steps in this process. The first would be to present
all working documents, opinions and consultations used in the decision making
process to the public (democratic transparency). Second step is to let the 
public actively engage with this process (in its extreme form this is a
[direct democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy) or
[e-democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-democracy)).

This post will briefly cover some projects that are working on building
open source software tools to increase the number of people involved in the
democratic decision making process.



On-line collaborative decision making
-------------------------------------

> People unwilling to govern themselves will be ruled by those deemed unfit to govern.
~ Plato, The Republic

With [world politics](http://davidjarvis.ca/world-politics/),
David Jarvis outlines with a simple example how such a collaborative decision
making tool could look like. This open source concept is hosted on 
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/djarvis/world-politics) and a worth while 
[list of references](https://bitbucket.org/djarvis/world-politics/wiki/Related%20Links)
of similar systems is maintained as well.

Some of the existing platforms in production use today present a very simple
interface for facilitating an on-line discussion around a proposal. For example,
with [Your Priorities](https://demo.yrpri.org/) (developed on 
[Github](https://github.com/rbjarnason/your-priorities)), you can cast votes
in favour and against, list pro's and con's, and engage in further discussion 
via a simple linear commenting thread. This approach seems suitable for simple
discussions and proposals involving a limited numnber of people, but I would argue
it will not scale properly to larger and more complex discussions. 

Another example is [Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/). Although it is relatively
similar to Your Priorities, the interface, using nice looking graphs among others,
is more polished and thought through in my opinion.
You can see the tool in action on some live open projects 
[here](https://www.loomio.org/explore). An interesting feature that clearly
distinguishes Loomio from others is that you can cast 4 different kind of votes:
either in favour, abstain, against or veto.

What I also find interesting about Loomio is how they are organized:
(and I quote from their web page):

> Loomio is built by a worker-owned cooperative. We’re a social enterprise
working to maximise positive social impact, not proﬁt 

After raising close to US$125,000 in a crowd-funding campaign, the open 
source development (taking place on [Github](https://github.com/loomio/loomio)) 
is assured to continue for some time to come. 

As a final example I would like to mention [Adhocracy](https://adhocracy.de/),
yet another tool for democratic participation, developed by the German non-profit
[LiquidDemocracy](https://liqd.net/en/) (code is on
[Github](https://github.com/liqd/adhocracy/)). Although it doesn't look as slick 
as Loomio in my opinion, this framework has been under continuous development
over the last years and there is no sign of reduced
[activity](https://github.com/liqd/adhocracy/graphs/contributors) either. 
Feature wise, the adhocracy platform is ahead of others by offering nested
discussion threads, more complex proposal description page including milestone
time line, map and member pages. 



Challenges
----------

This post very briefly looked at some open source tools that can be used for
on-line collaborative decision making. The reason why no propriety packages
are discussed here is because I think they are irrelevant in the context of 
transparency in governance: you can not thrust a black box system
with the powers of crucial political decision making. However, developing and
maintaining such a system reliably exceeds the capabilities of group of loosely
connected volunteers. Some sort of framework and funding has to be present.
In [Does an opensource approach help e-democracy?](http://spartakan.wordpress.com/2008/05/05/floss-projects-ande-pariticipation/) 
this topic is explored in more detail.

It is clear that a direct democracy with e-participation is not ready for today.
However, people are thinking about the problem and are making small steps
towards streamlined on-line decision making processes. Since there is a lot
to learn before getting there, every step counts!

When looking at projects such as Loomio and adhocracy, I believe that people
are moving towards more inclusive and participatory decision making processes.
Whether that is in small community teams, traditional companies or within
large national groups, it is a matter of time before they will become the norm.
