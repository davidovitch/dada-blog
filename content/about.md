Summary: Auther background information

Why do blogs have pages about their authors? Why do I feel it is necessary
to write something about myself here? The way I see it there are at least
a couple of reasons for doing so. However, I will only elaborate upon a
single one: the reason to put the blog into perspective. The title could
have been "a full disclosure" for that matter. With an ever increasing
influence of the social web 2.0 twitterish blogoshere, it is important,
IMHO, that we know why certain people are saying what they are saying. As
a reader it matters to me, I want to know if the writer of an article has a
double agenda. If the arms lobby puts forward a spokesman stating that more
arms will be beneficial for society, I know there is certain context that,
partly, places such wild claims into perspective. Even though this blog,
like many others, will have close to zero impact on the grand scheme of
things I believe it matters. It is only fair and decent that we know who
wrote something for what reason. All in the name of transparency.

So here goes, some dry facts about me, myself and I:

* born and raised in the region of Antwerp, Belgium (that's in Europe)

* a Steinerschool (aka Waldorf school,
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steiner_school)) adept, from
kindergarten until the end of high school (3-18 years)

* professionally active in wind energy research: studied [aerospace
engineering](http://www.lr.tudelft.nl/en/) at the TU Delft, and doing a PhD
at [DTU Wind Energy](http://www.vindenergi.dtu.dk/English.aspx) in Denmark
and that should be finished early-mid 2013.

* during my studies it became clear to me that sustainability (being green,
respect nature and human society, etc) is not only of paramount importance,
but it is also a seriously interesting field in engineering

* seriously enthusiastic about the open source software and the corresponding
movement; needles to say, I am a Linux user (Arch Linux to be precise)

* actively support the [Green political party](http://www.groen.be)
in Flanders

* injustice, extreme greed, and inefficient engineering processes are my
pet peeves

* art is important

So any ramblings you will find here can be expected to be of a greenish
inspired kitchen, are often marinated with open source dogma's, and are
usually cooked on the left spectrum of the stove.
